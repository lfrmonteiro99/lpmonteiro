      "As a Research Grant Holder at the University of Coimbra, I independently designed and developed two web platforms to support an academic research project. One platform facilitated CSV file uploads, data processing, and structured storage in PostgreSQL, while the other enabled data visualization and analysis, providing meaningful insights based on the research data. Working autonomously, I built full-stack solutions using PHP, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, and Bootstrap, ensuring responsive and user-friendly interfaces. I also configured Apache servers, designed efficient database structures, and implemented backend logic to handle large datasets effectively. While my colleagues focused on calculating research indicators, I was responsible for the entire development, deployment, and optimization of these platforms. This experience strengthened my ability to architect scalable, data-driven applications, optimize database performance, and manage full-cycle development in an academic research environment.",
